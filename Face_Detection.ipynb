    "\n",
    "The map() function in Python applies a given function to each item in an iterable (like a list or tuple) and returns a new iterator with the results. It’s particularly useful for quickly applying a transformation to each element in a collection.\n",
    "Breaking Down map(int, roi)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Function as the First Argument: map() takes a function as its first argument. Here, int is the function, which converts values to integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Iterable as the Second Argument: The second argument is an iterable, like a list or tuple, where each element will be processed by the function. In this case, roi is the iterable, containing four floating-point numbers representing (x, y, w, h) coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Application of map: map(int, roi) applies the int function to each element in roi. So, each float in (x, y, w, h) is passed to int(), converting it to an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Result\n",
    "\n",
    "    map(int, roi) produces a new iterator where each element of roi is converted to an integer.\n",
    "    Wrapping it with tuple(...) creates a tuple from this iterator, so now you have an integer version of the coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Use map()?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using map() is both concise and efficient. Instead of looping through roi and converting each element one by one, map(int, roi) handles the conversion in a single line, which is both clean and faster."
